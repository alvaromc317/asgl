## Introduction

`asgl` is a Python package that solves several regression related models for simultaneous variable selection and prediction, in low and high dimensional frameworks. This package is directly related to research work shown on [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11634-020-00413-8) and a full description of the capabilities of the package is shown on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00472). We also suggest accessing the  user_guide notebook provided in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alvaromc317/asgl). Or you can find more accesible explanations [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/sparse-group-lasso-in-python-255e379ab892) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-adaptive-lasso-63afca54b80d).

The current version of the package supports:

* Linear regression models
* Quantile regression models

And considers the following penalizations for variable selection:

* No penalized models
* lasso
* group lasso
* sparse group lasso
* adaptive lasso
* adaptive group lassso
* adaptive sparse group lasso

## Requirements 

The package makes use of some basic functions from `scikit-learn` and `numpy`, and is built on top of the wonderful `cvxpy` convex optimization module. It is higly encouraged to install `cvxpy` prior of the installation of `asgl` following the instructions from the original authors, that can be found [here](https://www.cvxpy.org/)). Additionally,  `asgl` makes use of python `multiprocessing` module, allowing, if requested, for parallel execution of the code highly reducing computation time.

## Usage example:

Even though the `asgl` package can easily deal with much more complex datasets, we will work using a synthetic dataset not affected by computation time. We will show first how to estimate a set of adaptive weights and fit the model using `asgl`. The following code estimates a set of adaptive weights using a PCA approach that has been shown to provide very good results in a general set of simulations and real data analysis. This approach is denoted as `'pca_pct'`. Then we estimate an linear regression model with an adaptive sparse group lasso penalization on a grid of possible `lambda1` values (2 values), `alpha` values (3 values) and weight values (3 values for the lasso weights and 1 value for the group lasso weight). You can check that the length of each of the parameters array is respectively 2, 3, 3 and 1. The estimated coefficients will be stored in the `coef_` object of the class.

```{python}
# Import required packages
import numpy as np
import asgl
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

x, y = make_regression(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
group_index = np.random.randint(1, 6, 20)

# Define parameters grid
lambda1 = np.array([1e-2, 1])
alpha = np.array([0, 0.5, 1])

# Estimate the adaptive weights using the pca_pct approach
weights = asgl.WEIGHTS(weight_technique='pca_pct', lasso_power_weight=[0.8, 1, 1.2])
lasso_weights, group_lasso_weights = weights.fit(x, y, group_index=group_index)

# Fit the adaptive sparse group lasso model on a grid of possible lambda1, alpha and weight values.
model = asgl.ASGL(model='lm', penalization='asgl', lambda1=lambda1, alpha=alpha,
                  lasso_weights=lasso_weights, gl_weights=group_lasso_weights)
```

The package also implements cross validation capabilities. The next example shows how to use cross validation to find the optimal parameter values in the previous dataset and how to compute the test error.

```{python}
# Define a cross validation object
cv_class = asgl.CV(model='lm', penalization='asgl', weight_technique='pca_pct', 
                   lambda1=lambda1, alpha=alpha, nfolds=3, error_type='MSE', 
                   parallel=True)

# Compute error using k-fold cross validation. 
# Error is a matrix of shape (number_of_models, k_folds)
error = cv_class.cross_validation(x=x, y=y, group_index=group_index)

# Obtain the mean error across different folds
error = np.mean(error, axis=1)

# Select the minimum error
minimum_error_idx = np.argmin(error)

# Select the parameters associated to mininum error values
optimal_parameters = cv_class.retrieve_parameters_value(minimum_error_idx)
```

```{python, echo=F}
optimal_parameters
```

Once obtained the set of optimal parameters, these can be used in a `asgl` model
like the one described in the first example to build the final optimized model.
